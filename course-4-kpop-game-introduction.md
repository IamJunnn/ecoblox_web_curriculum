#### Step 2: Understanding the Sustainability Story
**Instruction**: Read about why this game matters

**Content**:

Every year, millions of electric vehicle (EV) batteries reach the end of their useful life. But here's the cool part – these batteries still have 70-80% of their capacity left! Instead of throwing them away, we can **upcycle** them into Energy Storage Systems (ESS).

**In Our Game**:
1. Players collect **used EV batteries**
2. Take them to the **Battery Conversion Center**
3. Complete mini-games to convert them into **1kWh battery blocks**
4. Transport blocks to the **E-Charger Center**
5. Power an epic **K-Pop concert**!

**Real-World Impact**:
- Reduces electronic waste
- Saves precious materials (Lithium, Nickel, Manganese)
- Provides clean energy storage
- Teaches sustainable thinking

**Fun Fact**: A 100-person K-Pop concert needs about 100 kWh per hour. If the concert lasts 2 hours, you need 200 kWh total. That's 200 of your 1kWh battery blocks!

---

#### Step 5: Teamwork Strategies
**Instruction**: Learn how to work together effectively

**Strategy 1: Role Specialization**
Assign different tasks to different players based on strengths.

**Team Setup (3 players)**:
- **Player 1 (Collector)**: Focuses only on collecting batteries from drop-off
- **Player 2 (Converter)**: Stays at Conversion Center, great at mini-games
- **Player 3 (Upcycler)**: Stays at Upcycling Station, tracks energy meter

**Efficiency**:
- Each player masters their station
- No time wasted running around
- Assembly line approach
- Can process 3 batteries simultaneously!

---

**Strategy 2: Assembly Line**
Create a continuous flow of batteries.

**How It Works**:
```
Player 1: Collect → Hand off to Player 2
           ↓
Player 2: Convert → Hand off to Player 3
           ↓
Player 3: Upcycle → Energy stored!
           ↓
Player 1: (Already collecting next battery)
```

**Benefits**:
- Constant production
- No downtime
- Maximum efficiency
- Reach 200 kWh faster

---

**Strategy 3: Communication is Key**
Talk to your team!

**Important Callouts**:
- "Battery incoming!"
- "Mini-game failed, need another"
- "Energy at 75%, we're doing great!"
- "Only 50 kWh left to go!"
- "Concert halfway done, keep going!"

**Tools for Communication**:
- Voice chat (if available)
- Text chat in game
- Roblox chat system
- Discord/outside chat

---

**Strategy 4: Emergency Response**
What to do when things go wrong.

**Problem**: Energy meter dropping fast
**Solution**: All players switch to rapid collection mode

**Problem**: Player keeps failing mini-games
**Solution**: Swap roles, put different player at that station

**Problem**: Running out of batteries
**Solution**: Explore map for hidden battery spawn points

**Problem**: Concert almost over, need 30 kWh quick!
**Solution**: All players focus on easiest mini-game strategy

---

**Strategy 5: Planner's Coordination**
The Planner role is crucial for success!

**Planner Responsibilities During Game**:
- 📊 Monitor energy meter constantly
- ⏰ Track concert time remaining
- 📈 Calculate: "We need 15 more kWh per minute"
- 📢 Give team updates and motivation
- 🎯 Adjust strategy based on progress
- 📋 Take notes for post-game review

**Example Planner Dialogue**:
- "We're at 120/200 kWh, halfway there!"
- "Concert is 60% done, we need to speed up"
- "Great job team! On track to win!"
- "Emergency! Energy dropping fast, all hands on deck!"
